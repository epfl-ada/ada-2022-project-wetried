We are taking the logarithm because the range of pageviews vary greatly between languages.

The two regression models used are the following:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Excluding the data loading/wrangling, this first part serves as a preliminary analysis of the Coronawiki dataset content related to environmental topics. Firstly, we saw that statistically speaking, for a majority of the available countries, there was indeed a difference between the visits to environmental topics between the years of 2019 and 2020; this difference wasn't always an increase for all languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using that as a basis, we asked ourselves whether we can predict these views using only the changes in transportations mode/visits to certain places, for every language. We saw that it appears to be possible, but not always interpretable, and there may be a lack of contextualisation, i.e it's not certain that if we had the same data but from another year (for example 2019), we would have the same results. In order to do that, we resort to difference-in-difference regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the considered time period and year, a general increase of environment views is clear after the mobility change compared to both after a return to normalcy, and before that same mobility change for every language. Note that in this case, we did use the 2019 data as well, so we see that the fact that there is an increase in 2020 is indeed related to Covid-related restrictions. However, we asked ourselves another question at this point: yes, there is an increase happening during the first Covid wave, but this translate directly into environmental awareness?\n",
    "\n",
    "To attempt to answer that, we decided to study the similarities between the evolution of the global wikipedia views, and the evolution of wikipedia views related to the environement.\n",
    "The DTW analysis showed that for a lot of languages, both of the corresponding timeseries are really close to each others in distance and behave very similarly. This seems to indicate that an increase in environment views was most of the time, because of an increase Wikipedia usage in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complement this analysis, we decided to look at the time lagged cross correlation. Unfortunatly, other than for German for which time lagged cross correlation attains its maximun of 0.75 with a lag of 140 compared to the unlagged correlation of 0.5, most of the languages achieve maximum cross correlation for a lag of 0 or 1, and therefore both of their time series are almost superposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More over, since the environement views and wikipedia views behave the same, we decided to study the ranking of the environement topic compared to other topics, either by separating the languages or aggregating them all together. The results we have seems to indicate that people were more preoccupied with other topics than the environment during the first Covid wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it seems that for now, the increase in environement views in 2020 isn't necessarily due to a sudden awarness as its rankind drops to 51, but to a increase in wikipedia views. However, it doesn't mean that more awareness wasn't there; our data does stop in July 2020 after all; plus, the Wikipedia views alone aren't enough to confirm a change in awareness, we need to have a better look at the general behavior of people. In order to complement our analysis, we add the usage in the followning part of external datasets related to pollution, and even more Wikipedia data to see the evolution of environment related views after 2020.

    "We saw that in some countries the plastic production experienced a significant decrease during covid, especially around 2020 we saw quite a drop probably due to lockdown. However, recycling rates and recovery rates did not experience significant change, More over The amount of waste generated decreased between 2018 and 2020 although one might question the validity of this due to a low amount of data.\n",

France and Germany also show a similar behavior, but with a seemingly higher variance.

Second, we cannot establish causality in such sequential data, as we would need to also witness an alternative universe where covid did not happen.

    "We find that for most countries, past wikipedia views make for a good linear predictor of the future of air pollution. This even holds for Turkey where the air pollution got worse during Covid.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting case is that of Japan and South Korea which have very insignificant p-values (>.2), suggesting that day-to-day linear prediction is not very convincing for these two countries. We note that these are the only Eastern-Asian countries in the dataset. An interesting extension to this project could be to check whether this extends further to other countries in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odd one out is then Serbia, with a p-value of 0.21. There is an explanation which we find satisfying : while air pollution follows the same patterns as similar European countries, the wikipedia views on the environment topic in Serbia are fairly unusual when compared to neighboring countries. Indeed, there is a massive spike around 2020-04, the time at which Covid hit the country. Previously, the article had significnatly fewer views. For most other countries, the process was much more continuous. We see no particular reason as to why the awareness differs, but this explains why the Granger test sees no significant use of wikipedia views for predicting the air pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all others, the linear prediction works out fine. The model is confident that the past of the wikipedia views is a useful tool to predict the air pollution of the next day in the capital."

    "In this final part, we want to create a hypothetical scenario of 2022 using statistical forecasting without the data from that year. The idea is to show whether the direction air pollution is taking is predictable, and where it is headed.\n",

    "We will analyze the data in the following way : we will predict whether the air pollution in the period of 2022 can be meaningfully predicted from the previous years.\n",
    "Ideally, the plan was to attempt to predict what would have heppened by training the model on air data from 2015 to 2019 and predicting 2020-2022, in order to compare with what actually happened.\n",
    "It turns out, the air data is not available so long in the past. We had to modify the analysis to analyze from 2019-2021 and predict 2022, to give the model data on which it could be trained.\n",
    "This modifies a bit the intent of the analysis. Instead of seeing whether there is a downwards perturbance in air pollution (which we already know happened), we now ask a slightly different question : \"does the air pollution in 2022 significantly change from the trends of 2019-2021, and if so, what is the direction of the change?\". This will give us insights into what the different countries have \"learned\". For example, a year 2022 that is unpredictably low in terms of air pollution means that the country has (for now) learned that it could survive without as much pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be other explanations (the country never economically recovered from Covid, ...) but there is little we can do to account for this in time. Besides, speaking only in terms of air pollution, the conclusion is the same : the country is for the foreseeable future on its way to have a better air."
